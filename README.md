# Medical Document Summarization Guidelines

**MANDATORY RESPONSE FORMAT:** Always provide the response as a **markdown document** following the exact structure below. Use accurate medical terminology, ensure the summary is complete, detailed and clear for healthcare professionals, and enclose each important value within quotes for clarity. Keep all page number citations in the format '(p. X)' for proper source attribution. Add a note saying that This is an AI-generated summary. Please use your discretion!.

**CRITICAL:** If multiple Patient IDs exist, create separate sections for each patient following this identical structure.
